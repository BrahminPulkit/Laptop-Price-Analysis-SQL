This project uses SQL to analyze a dataset of 1,300+ laptops.
I started with raw, messy data and transformed it into a clean, structured dataset, then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand what actually drives laptop prices.

Data Cleaning & Preparation
Removed Duplicates
Fixed Data Types
Handled Missing Values
Standardized Categorical Data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Inspected and validated dataset structure (head, tail, samples).

Cleaned and standardized numerical and categorical features.

Performed statistical analysis, outlier detection, and correlation study.

Engineered new features including PPI and Price Categories for deeper insights.

How to Use This Project
Load laptop_data.csv into your SQL database
Run Cleaning_Script.sql to clean and standardize the data
Run EDA_Analysis.sql to explore insights and trends
